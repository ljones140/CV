## Lewis Jones

Determined and ambitious with a strong desire to learn. After working in retail logistics decided I wanted to work in tech three years ago so taught myself what I needed to get a job as a application support engineer, was promoted to senior engineer and then team lead within two years. During this time I fell in love with code so applied to Makers academy to accelerate my learning. Now looking to join a company who will foster my first steps as an junior developer in an environment where I will be given the opportunity and support to develop my craft where what I give back will be valued.

#### Proactive Problem Solving

During my time working at Gorkana Group in the application support team I often would enjoy the challenge of solving problems by using tools and methods that had not been used in the past by my department. For example I identified a problem where me and my team were spending a lot of time writing similar SQL reports to retrieve customer data. I was teaching myself PHP at the time and got sign off from the head of IT to create a set of internal web pages that could be used by the customer services team to run the reports themselves. This reduced the workload on the apps support team and showed me how that business problems could be solved with code if you take the time to understand what the business  needs are.


#### Clean Code and Test Driven Development

During my time at Makers Academy I have absorbed the principles that they teach and I aspire to write high quality test driven code. I understand that I still have a lot to learn with coding and I find that I can spot a code smell but may lack the actual coding experience

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)
