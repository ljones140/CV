## Lewis Jones

Determined and ambitious with a strong desire to learn. After working in retail logistics decided I wanted to work in tech. Taught myself what I needed to get a job in application support, promoted to senior engineer then team lead all within two years. Through this I fell in love with code so applied to Makers academy to accelerate my learning. Now looking to join a company who will foster my first steps as a junior developer.

#### Proactive Problem Solving

While working at Gorkana Group I solved problems using tools not previously used by my department. For example I identified an issue where several times a week my team were repeatedly writing similar SQL reports requested by customer services. I was teaching myself PHP at the time and got sign off to create a set of internal web pages for customer services to run the reports themselves. It taught me that business problems could be solved with code if you understand what the business needs are.


#### Desire to Craft High Quality Code

At Makers Academy I was exposed to good coding principles which has improved my ability to write good, test driven clean code. I understand that I have a lot to learn and although I can spot a code smell I may not at this moment have the skills to clear it up as well as I would like. I aspire to write code that is elegant, well crafted, I am proud of and enjoy returning to.
