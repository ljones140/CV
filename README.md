## Lewis Jones

Determined and ambitious with a strong desire to learn. After working in retail logistics decided I wanted to work in tech three years ago so taught myself what I needed to get a job as a application support engineer, was promoted to senior engineer and then team lead within two years. During this time I fell in love with code so applied to Makers academy to accelerate my learning. Now looking to join a company who will foster my first steps as an junior developer in an environment where I will be given the opportunity and support to develop my craft where what I give back will be valued.

#### Proactive Problem Solving

During my time working at Gorkana Group in the application support team I often would enjoy the challenge of solving problems by using tools and methods that had not been used in the past by my department. For example I identified a problem where me and my team were spending a lot of time writing similar SQL reports to retrieve customer data. I was teaching myself PHP at the time and got sign off from the head of IT to create a set of internal web pages that could be used by the customer services team to run the reports themselves. This reduced the workload on the apps support team and showed me how that business problems could be solved with code if you take the time to understand what the business  needs are.


#### Desire to Craft High Quality Code

At Makers Academy I was exposed to coding principles which has improved my the ability to write high quality test, driven clean code. I understand that I have a lot to learn and although I can spot a code smell I may not at this moment have the experience to clear it up as much as I would like. I aspire to write code that is elegant, well crafted, that I am proud of and enjoy returning to and other developers can understand with ease.

!!! May put links to examples of code where I feel the above is relevant !!!
