## Lewis Jones

A determined and ambitious junior Software Developer with a strong desire to learn.

I strive for quality and craftsmanship in everything I do and am looking for an opportunity to further my knowledge whilst contributing to real-world projects and problem solving.

After working in Retail Logistics for five years, I decided to move into Technology. I taught myself what was needed to get a job in Application Support at Gorkana, and was quickly promoted to Senior Engineer and then Team Lead within two years. During this time I was learning to program Ruby and PHP at home, and wrote some PHP and Perl at work. I realised programming was what I wanted to do, so applied to Makers Academy to accelerate my learning. I am now looking to join a company who will foster my first steps as a junior developer and give me the opportunity and support to develop my craft.

#### Proactive Problem Solving

While working at Gorkana I found new ways to solve the problems we were repeatedly encountering in my department.

For example, I realised that my team was repeatedly writing similar SQL reports for the Customer Services department. I created a web app in PHP to allow Customer Services to run the reports themselves. It taught me that there are many opportunities to improve business productivity with software if you can understand the business's needs.

We had a platform for emailing press releases to journalists. There was a bug where the processing of bounceback emails would stop without alerting. I created a Perl script that curled an internal API that returned JSON with queue statistics. If the bounceback queue was above a threshold the script would email IT support to indicate an issue. It was set up to run automatically on a crontab to provide alerting.


#### Desire to Craft High Quality Code

At Makers Academy I was exposed to good coding principles which has improved my ability to write good, test-driven clean code. I understand that I have a lot to learn and although I can spot a code smell I may not at this moment have the skills to clear it up as well as I would like. I aspire to write code that is elegant, well crafted, I am proud of and enjoy returning to.

#### Projects  

[**StieglitzGram**](https://github.com/ljones140/StieglitzGram) is an online photography gallery. It is written using Rails, Jquery, Foundation and PostgreSQL. It is tested using RSpec, Capybara, Factory Girl and Poltergeist to test the JavaScript.I am particularly proud of the elegance of the controllers as they thin and the logic is with the model. I learned how to use Factory Girl effectively with my tests to  mock and create objects where required.


[**Live-Voting**](https://github.com/ljones140/live-voting) this was my final project at Makers Academy. An application for speakers at events. uses websockets to push questions to audience members. As votes come in the speakers display shows a graph that changes dynamically . We held daily standups which allowed the project to evolve in the agile process. By doing this project I learned how a team project grows with BDD and how multiple pairs of programmers can work on the same code base at the same time.

#### Tech Sprint 2015 Hackathon Winner of 3 awards

* Best Overall Product
* Best Mix of Technology
* Most Complete Product

I was part of a team that won the above three awards . We built a single page application to replace the sponsor Euromoney's intranet in AngularJS and Node.js. During the event we worked on two hour sprints and deployed our code every two hours to ensure we had a working product for our live demo at the presentation.
